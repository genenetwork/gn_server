# GnServer Architecture

## Introduction

GnServer's main task is to serve a REST API for
GeneNetwork. Essentially it uses the Elixir programming language and
Erlang VM to leverage the strengths of data transformation and highly
parallel processing in a convenient functional programming paradigm.

## Executing external commands

GnServer can execute external commands by using System.cmd locally, or
GnExec remotely (System.cmd arguably belongs in GnExec).

A system command returns a return value (`retval=int`) and logs from
stdout and stderr. In addition resulting data is returned.

The interface is the same as with GnExec. To prevent sending
unneccessary data over the network the call returns the first time
with the retval and a token. The token is actually a calculated Hash
value (over the inputs) and is used to retrieve (progress) status and
the rest of the data which is waiting in a TEMPDIR.

The caller can add what files to expose in addition to STDOUT. The
only futher setting is whether a user wants to combine STDOUT and
STDERR in STDOUT - usually the case when return data is not part of
STDOUT.

So the first call to a program looks like the following REST sequence. First
set up the program with a dataset:

    URL/program/dataset.json

This returns a JSON record with a value and a token. For example

    {"retval" => 0, "token" => "8412ab517c6ef9c2f8b6dae3ed2a60cc"}

Now the program is running and we can get status updates with

    URL/program/8412ab517c6ef9c2f8b6dae3ed2a60cc/status.json

which returns

    {"retval" => 145, "progress" => 40, "token" => "8412ab517c6ef9c2f8b6dae3ed2a60cc"}

which says that the program is at 40% progress. When complete it should look like

    {"retval" => 0, "progress" => 100, "token" => "8412ab517c6ef9c2f8b6dae3ed2a60cc"}

and now retval should contain a UNIX error value (retval 144=queued,
145=running, 146=killed, all other non zero values are errors).

After completion, to fetch the return data do

    URL/program/output/8412ab517c6ef9c2f8b6dae3ed2a60cc/result.json

or in whatever format. In fact, there is now an output directory named

    /var/tmp/8412ab517c6ef9c2f8b6dae3ed2a60cc/

on the server which contains all output files, including a file named
STDOUT (optionally STDERR) which can be fetched with

    URL/program/output/8412ab517c6ef9c2f8b6dae3ed2a60cc/STDOUT

even when the job errored out.  Other output files can also be fetched
by appending the filename(s).

One of the advantages of using the Hash value is that when an output
directory already exists it does not have to be recomputed. Results
can be returned immediately. To force a recalculation (say on error)
we add a parameter to the original command:

    URL/program/dataset.json?force_recompute=1

or

    URL/program/dataset.json?recompute_on_error=1

Another option is to kill a running job with

    URL/program/8412ab517c6ef9c2f8b6dae3ed2a60cc/status.json?kill=1

should return

    {"retval" => 146, "token" => "8412ab517c6ef9c2f8b6dae3ed2a60cc"}

A mechanism is in place to prevent two of the same jobs running on the
same system. Once a job is running it is automatically shared between
the two 'users'.

## TechPlan

GnServer will leverage GnExec in many ways.



### GnExec Overview

Excute GnServer jobs on remote hosts following an opportunistic or [disperse
computing](http://www.darpa.mil/program/dispersed-computing) approach.

Delegate job execution to volunteer computing


GnExec is an ensemble solution

  1. Local store for jobs
  2. Execute locally stored jobs
  3. GnServer REST API client

GnExec use only Elixir and Erlang libraries and tools. The local store will be based on Mnesia.


### General Overview

- Dispatch jobs upon client request.
- Collect results and metrics from clients.
- Aggegate metric to learn how better distribute the jobs to clients.
- Distribute the same job multiple times, collect the first computed result.
- Upon client/job resul, wait interaction from other client with the
  same/similar job and instruct them to continue or terminate their computation.
- Test system, server will provide test data for each required computation
  to perform metrics and verify the ability of the client to satisfy server requests.
- Client declares its available resources, the Central Dipatch Unit (CDU) try to
  match and predict the *optimal* parameters if availabe and estimate the computing time
  to provide a feedback to the end user.
- Metrics:
  - *To Be Defined (TBD)*


### Why REST?

Builing an interoperable decentralized computing infrastructure is a challenging task.

REST will let us develop clients that satisfty specific requirements in terms
of security, infrastructure, platform and OS.

Solid building blocks, Elixir for its semplicity to create reliable services based
on Erlang capabilities dealing with fault tolerance and distributed systems.


### Volunteers

We defined volunteers any client that consumes the GnExec REST API.
Our primary target is to leverage by [GnServer](https://github.com/genenetwork/gn_server)
the computing power of the [BEACON](https://www.nics.tennessee.edu/beacon) at
University of Tennessee in a secure way.


### Todo

- [] search for a formal definition of *Opportunistic Computing* or papers

### API

Client can not list available jobs for to reduce the risk of inspecting workload or server activities.

### Workflow

The system is designed to be stateless, or to minimize the amount of information saved on the server side.
API are versioned to improve functionalities over time. Version 0.1 will be very simple with a limited number of controls and security checks.

Server and client will communicate over REST, websocket could be used in the future for better control if needed.

List of possible improvements

* client provides information about its computing capabilities
* server dispatch to certain client specific jobs
* server store statistics about clients
* manage clients account
* transferring huge files
* describe the required environment to execute the computation.
